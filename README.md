# STEPin_Restaurant_Food_Ordering_Management_System
## Introduction
The Restaurant Food Ordering Management System Project in C is a consoled based application created using c programming language. This system is a simple mini project and compiled in **VS Codes Both on Windows and Linux operating systems** using **GCC compiler**. This c programming project focuses on Restaurant food ordering and how to calculate the bill based on the quantities ordered. In this project, we have login and signup where customers and Admin can Log into the system. Inside the system customers can view the Menu on the basis of food sections like Starter, Main course and dessert food sections and order accordingly. The customer needs to register first then he has the access to the menu window. The customer can watch his previous orders. We have Admin section too where admin needs to login and can view the menu and previous orders. Apart from this the admin has the access to add or modify the meals.
